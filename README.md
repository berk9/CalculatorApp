# CalculatorApp
The project was written using Intellij IDEA. This is a GUI-application that I developed in JAVA using the javax.swing and java.awt libraries. The program uses a basic JFRAME GUI which  allows the user to input their calculations into various JTextFields in order to perform their mathematical operations.
